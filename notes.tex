\subsection{Example}
A context free grammar consists of some special symbols: terminals, non-terminals, and a start symbol (which is a special kind of non-terminal). These are special kinds of strings, so let's make them subclasses of \verb|String|. The start symbol is a special kind of \verb|NonTerminal|, so let's make that a subclass too.
