Documentation-style specs go at the top. 
To support documentation specs, use example CFGs in documentation. 
Move #parse out into CFG. 
Change #write to #to_s; think about how to implement String API. 
Remove short factories. More verbose, clearer method names. 
Add examples of popular CFGs, including HTML, JSON, and arithmetic. 
Investigate performance and correctness of #parse. 
Document the implementation & correspondence to the mathematical model. 
Rules given in Backus-Naur form. 
Support for empty-productions.
Encapsulate as a gem.
